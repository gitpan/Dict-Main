Dict-Main version 1.2
======================

This is a dictionary from Arabic to Italian:
for every word coming from the input file, these modules are able to take out the radix, look for the translation according to the radix and exporting the whole dictionary DB in HTML or LaTeX.
Main features are:
->finding the radix, which is accomplished by chopping away all the prefixes and suffixes, and by some characters removal at the end.
->exportation. This is a real good thing for Arabic students like me, so that I may easily memorize the meaning of a radix. This way, the finding the translation of a word while translating "on-the-fly" will be easier and faster.

All the vocabulary databases are located in ./dicts/, these files may be directly modified without any harm to the script execution.
Moreover I'm working on an importation module, so that new radixes/terms may be added easily and quickly to the local database.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires no other modules, just Perl >=5.8.1


MODULES

Dict::Main::Radix
	this will return the radix of a word

Dict::Main::
	

Dict::Main::Display_html
	this will export all the dictionary in a HTML form, placed in the ./html/ directory.

Dict::Main::Display_latex
	this will export all the dictionary in a LaTeX form, placed in the ./latex/ directory. Note that you'd need the ArabTeX package installed if you are going to create a DVI or PDF from that source file.

Dict::Main::Import
	this will import the content of every specified file, if the lines are correctly formatted (ignored otherwise)


NOTES

->Everything (script code and data) works ONLY if raw data is encoded in Unicode (utf8 or UTF-8). Other representations will lead to errors or wrong results.
->Please use non-formatted text as input data.
Using Microsoft Word .doc files, Adobe .pdf or HTML pages WILL cause problems.
->Every database name begins with a '%' so that it isn't hidden by the shell in case it begins with a period.
->The syntax for vocabulary database is the following:

"\t arabic-radix

arabic name\t italian translation"

where '\t' means TAB (tabulation, NOT sum of whitespaces)
->The syntax for files to be imported is the following:

"Italian_name = Arabic_name"
